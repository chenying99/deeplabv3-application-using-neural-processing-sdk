# QDN DeepLabV3 Android Application

The project is designed to utilize the Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK, a deep learning software from Qualcomm Snapdragon Platforms. The Neural Processing SDK is used to convert trained models from Caffe, Caffe2, ONNX, TensorFlow to Snapdragon supported format (.dlc format). We further utilize these models in Android application to perform semantic segmentation using DeepLab V3 support in NPE.
## Pre-requisites

## How does it work?
QDN Image Segmentation application opens a camera preview, clicks a picture and converts it to bitmap. The network is built via  Neural Network builder by passing deeplabv3.dlc as the input. The bitmap is then given to model for inference, which returns FloatTensor output. The output is again set for post-processing to achieve background manipulation (changing the background color to black and white) of the original input image.


## Steps to Install and Run the Application
* Firstly set up the hardware as shown above in the hardware setup section
* Power on the Snapdragon HDK board
* Connect the Dev-Board/Android phone via USB to the device
* Switch on the display and choose the USB connection option to File Transfer
* Check if ADB is installed in the windows/linux device, if not follow the below instructions in the below link to install
	https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html.
* Use the below command to install the apk with the connected device with help of adb. [Download APK(Debug)](https://github.com/jinka2015/QDN-DeepLabV3-NPE/blob/master/AndroidApplication/output/qdn_segmentation.apk)

	$ adb install qdn_segmentation.apk
* Search the QC Image Segmentation in the app menu and launch the application
